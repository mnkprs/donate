 *    must be emitted by that router — not a foreign contract (`wrong-router`).
 * 2. The receipt contains a `DonationRouted` log whose `org` field equals
 *    `charity.endaomentOrgAddress` (case-insensitive via EIP-55 normalisation).
 * 3. The ERC20 `Transfer` logs from the router sum to `net`:
 *    - All transfers where `from === routerAddress` are collected.
 *    - The Eudaimonia platform-fee leg is excluded: the single transfer where
 *      `value === routedArgs.fee && to !== expectedOrg`. This is the router →
 *      Eudaimonia treasury transfer (`DonationRouted.fee`).
 *    - The remaining router-out transfers must sum to `routedArgs.net`.
 *    - This accommodates both the legacy single-transfer mock (one Transfer of
 *      `net` to org) and the real two-transfer Endaoment Entity pull model
 *      (router → Endaoment treasury + router → entity, summing to `net`).
 *    - When `routerAddress` is unknown (env unset), falls back to the simple
 *      assertion: a single `Transfer(_, org, net)` must be present.
 *
 * Any *mismatch* returns `{ verified: false, reason }` so the receipt UI can
 * display a structured result. This function is NOT total, however — callers
 * MUST handle thrown errors. It can throw on:
 *   - RPC/transport failure from `client.getTransactionReceipt` (network down,
 *     node error, tx not found).
 *   - A log whose `topics[0]` matches `DonationRouted` but whose payload is
 *     corrupt: `decodeDonationRoutedLog` throws rather than returning a
 *     failure reason, because a matching topic that fails to decode indicates
 *     malformed/spoofed data, not a normal verification mismatch.
 *
 * @param txid The transaction hash to look up.
 * @param charity The donation target — must carry a non-null `endaomentOrgAddress`.
 * @param chainId The chain the transaction was submitted on.
 * @returns A `VerifyDonationResult` — discriminated on `verified`.
